                                                  Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
 Sentiment Classification is a perfect problem in NLP for getting started in it. i had  learn a lot of concepts and techniques to master through doing project.
 
 
 
 


    
    
    
 Text Classification is a process involved in Sentiment Analysis. It is classification of peoples opinion or expressions into different sentiments. Sentiments include Positive, Neutral, and Negative, Review Ratings and Happy, Sad.
  
  Here i have used famous dataset on sentiments available on kaggle platform, where i have practice on this dataset and use concepts:
  1.pre-train glove word embeddings  ,used to convert word tokens into their vectors forms
  2. Text preprocessing techniques like Stemming/ Lematization, removing stopwords
  3. regex library to remove hyperLinks, mentions etc.
  
  
  Model Training - LSTM
We are clear to build our Deep Learning model. While developing a DL model, we should keep in mind of key things like Model Architecture, Hyperparmeter Tuning and Performance of the model.

As you  in the word cloud, the some words are predominantly feature in both Positive and Negative tweets. This could be a problem if we are using a Machine Learning model like Naive Bayes, SVD, etc.. That's why we use Sequence Models.
